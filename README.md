# Fallout 4 VR Body
Developing mod to add full body support with IK for Fallout 4 VR!

Now released on Nexus!!! https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/53464/

Current status:
- Arm IK 100%
- Body positioning 95%.   Needs some refinement on body rotation
- leg IK work mostly done.   Walking added.    Body is a little "stiff" so need to see how to make it a bit more natural
- Power armor 90%.    Works well generally but needs some help with consistent height scaling as well as some nodes are not attached to the body.
- bulk weapon repositioning mostly done.     Need to rotate some melee still and grenade are offset
- Pipboy now working with haptics.    Only really works with static scale.     this can certainly be improved but it is functional
- added papyrus holotap config
- added support for attached detection spheres for papyrus events to the skeleton bones

Next Steps
- Polish
- Profit
