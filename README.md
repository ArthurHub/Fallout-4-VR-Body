# Fallout 4 VR Body
Developing mod to add full body support with IK for Fallout 4 VR!

Note this is a work in progress....

Current status:
- Body positioned under camera appropriately though code that lets you move the camera around a bit needs work
- Arm IK coming closer.    Skyrim and Fallout skeletons are different in the local space of nodes so can't just reuse lessons learnt from vrik.   

Next Steps:
- Finish Arm IK
- Work on body position and scale under camera
- Implement some form of walking animation and IK
- ???
- Profit
