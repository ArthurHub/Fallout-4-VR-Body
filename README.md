# Fallout 4 VR Body
Developing mod to add full body support with IK for Fallout 4 VR!

Note this is a work in progress....

Current status:
- Arm IK 100%
- Body positioning 95%.   Needs some refinement on body rotation
- leg IK work started.   hope to be quick from already done the harder IK with the arms.    Will need to figure out some kind of walking animation
- Power armor 90%.    Works well generally but needs some help with consistent height scaling as well as some nodes are not attached to the body.
- bulk weapon repositioning mostly done.     Need to rotate some melee still and grenade are offset
- Pipboy now working with haptics.    Only really works with static scale.     this can certainly be improved but it is functional
- added papyrus holotap config
- added support for attached detection spheres for papyrus events to the skeleton bones

Next Steps
- Implement some form of walking animation and IK
- ???
- Profit
