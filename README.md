# Fallout 4 VR Body
Developing mod to add full body support with IK for Fallout 4 VR!

Note this is a work in progress....

Current status:
- Arm IK 95% complete.   Not completely happy with elbow position and twisting so will need to make one more pass
- Body positioning almost complete.   Posture working nice.  Annoying positioning when you bend over enough your camera looks backwards.   But very close to complete
- leg IK work started.   hope to be quick from already done the harder IK with the arms.    Will need to figure out some kind of walking animation
- Power armor "works" however there are issues.
- bulk weapon repositioning mostly done.     Need to rotate some melee still and grenade are offset
- Pipboy now working with haptics.    Only really works with static scale.     this can certainly be improved but it is functional

Next Steps:
- Finish Arm IK
- finish body positioning
- Implement some form of walking animation and IK
- ???
- Profit
